## Project Proposal

COVID-19 has been spreading rapidly around the world. With the growing attention on the deadly pandemic, discussions and research on COVID-19 are rapidly increasing to exchange latest findings with the hope to accelerate the pace of finding a cure.
The goal of this project will be a unsupervised machine learning model that will be a topic modeling/recommendation system using COVID-19 data to develop an algorithm showing only relevant articles and latest research studies regarding covid-19 progress.

### Data

The main dataset for this project will be taken from kaggle.com

### Tools

The analysis and modeling will be done in Python, Pandas will be used for EDA and manipulation. sklearn will be used for modeling. matplotlib and seaborn will be used for visualization.

### MVP

The MVP for this project will be a model that represents topics related to the covid-19 research.
