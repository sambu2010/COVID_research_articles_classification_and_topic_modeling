## Coronavirus topic modeling

The goal of this project is an unsupervised machine learning model that will be a topic modeling/recommendation system using COVID-19 data to develop an algorithm showing only relevant articles and latest research studies regarding covid-19 progress

To start exploring this goal I acquired the data from CORD-19 (Covid-19 Open Research Dataset) and used LDA to build initial topic model with 25 components

 The model is still requires tuning, this will be done next.
